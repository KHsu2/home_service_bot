# home_service_bot
Final Project for Udacity's Robotics Nanodegree that simulates a robot operating on ROS to find an object and deliver it to a goal. The following ROS packages were used: turtlebot, turtlebot_interactions, turtlebot_simulations, and slam_gmapping. 


The student should include a brief write-up explaining the packages used for this project, covering localization, mapping and navigation.
